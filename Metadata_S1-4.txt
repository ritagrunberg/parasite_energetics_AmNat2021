Metadata for data S1 and S2:
Column_headers. 

host_species: genus and species of host taxa 
code: unique identifier of host individual used in the analysis 
parasite_flux:  unit watts; temperature corrected parasite community flux following equation 6 in the main text; parasite flux = [(a*parasite body mass (kg) ^b)* exp((E_parasite/0.0000862)*(-((Temp_O+273.15)^-1) + ((Temp+273.15)^-1))))] * parasite abundance) and summed across all parasite species, where a = phylum specific normalization constant from table 1 in maint text and b = phylum specific scaling exponenet from table 1.  
mh_alpha: unit watts; temperature corrected host metabolic rate following equation 5 in the maint text; host metabolic rate = (a * host body mass (kg) ^ b) * exp((E_host/0.0000862)*(-((Temp_O+273.15)^-1) + ((Temp+273.15)^-1))))
mh_alpha_no_temp: unit watts; host metabolic rate following equation 5 in the maint text; host metabolic rate = (a * host body mass (kg) ^ b) 
mh: units grams; host body mass 
np: total parasite abundance, which is all parasite individuals within a host 
n: number of hosts dissected; using a min. of 15 individuals per host species
avg_alpha: unit watts; mean energy usage within a parasite community see main text for calculation (note this is not temp corrected)
host_taxon: host taxonomic group, pertains to metabolic scaling parameters in table 1
Temp_O: units celsius; environmental temperature during collection period (notes needs to transforemd to kelvin for temperature correction)
